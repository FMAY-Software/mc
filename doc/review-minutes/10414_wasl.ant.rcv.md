_- 04  min   bob  requirements      Add the requirement ID to the short descriptions in the requirement section to consistently link this doc to the SRS requirements.
_- 05  min   bob  5.1      Move this sentence about conclusion to the conclusion section
_- 06  min   keith  5.1      Add blank row between dialect sections
_- 07  min   bob  5.1      Highlight "challenges", it is like threats from the SWOT, but "challenges" should be called out
_- 08  min   bob  5.1      alf is missing learning curve
_- 09  maj   bob  5.1      rethink opportunities/threats.
_- 10  min   bob  5.2      ROM effort is in man-weeks. This should be specified
_- 11  min   cort  5.2      Add "*" to call out that no prototype has been done
_- 12  min   cort  5.3      move table to end
_- 13  min   levi  5.4      there are things that dont exist in masl that do in smasl. The definition of smasl needs to be updated.
_- 14  min   bob  5.4.table     "convert Relationship and Event" ->  "Convert the Relationship and Event models"
_- 15  min   cort  5.4      remove the recommendation (it is covered in the conclusion)
_- 16  min   bob  5.5      same as observation #14 (make it clear these are model names)
_- 17  min   keith  5.7      "both direction" -> "both directions"
_- 18  min   keith  5.7.1       typo - the word testing is repeated

_- 22  maj   Cort 6  6      Number 1 recommendation is to move to BP, and stay with ASL. The following steps will show recommended path to do that.
_- 23  min   levi  6.5/5.?      xtUML2WASL command-line is called out in a couple places, but WASL2xtUML command-line is not. This seems inconsistent.
_- 24  min   bob  6.9.4      typo (missing word)
_- 25  min   levi  6.9      have designated people be active in the xtuml community. Perhaps these people should even know how to build BP (so they are familiar with this open source product and process around it)
