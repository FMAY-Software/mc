= MASL exporter emits warnings for core types

xtUML Project Implementation Note

:sectnums:

== Abstract

Benign but confusing warnings are being issued during the export of MASL.
This work resolves the root cause and simplifies the way BridgePoint
manages MASL-specific data types.

== Introduction and Background

When Raven was originally developed, MC-3020 was not able to process
UUIDs and 128 integers; now, MC-3020 can.  This opens an option for
linking imported MASL types to BridgePoint types more naturally.

A change is introduced in how xtUML native types are introduced in the MASL
to xtUML conversion.  Background to the present way of working is supplied
here.  "Global" types (native xtUML core data types) had been created as-needed
in the masl2xtuml processing.  Identifiers were supplied with patterns that
could be matched and dumped in a way that BridgePoint proper could load
them correctly.

== Requirements

=== Eliminate warnings emitted due to unbound types.
=== Bind Global types in `m2x`.

== Work Required

=== Detect Unbound Types More Accurately in `x2m`
First, check if the type is based on 'MASLtype'.  If it is, this is a
type reference type and should never be qualified with the containing
domain name.

Second, check if the package is directly off the system.  In this case,
it is assumed that the user understands that the package is not contained
by a component, so it will _not_ be qualified.  A special case that is
important for this check is the 'types' package which contains MASL core
types and is generated directly off the system.  This check prevents types
in this package from ever being qualified.

=== Instance-Dump String UUIDs
Now that MC-3020 understands UUIDs both as integers and as strings, dump
the string version from the instance dumper.  This allows the xtUML Model
importer to link types with no special processing (e.g. help of IDLINK).

=== Load and Link Globals
As stated in <<Introduction and Background>>, Global types were supplied
by `m2x` in a special-purpose manner.  A Better Way is now provided that
utilizes the existing Globals definition of BridgePoint (`Globals.xtuml`).
`m2x` now loads the `Globals.xtuml` file containing instance definitions
of the core data types.  A command line option '-g' is added to `m2x` to
pass in the path to the globals file.  After being loaded, the types can
be linked to the model elements appropriately.

An initialization function, `initialize_globals` is introduced to run
immediately after start-up and loading of the global data types.  This
routine creates a package for the global types and links the types into it.

== Implementation Comments

=== `getopt`
There was a bug in the configuration of the options for getopt in the C
model compiler utitilies.  The argument for an argument was marked optional
when it should not have been.  This confusion was caused, because the options
(like -o) were indeed optional.  But when the option is given, the optarg is
_not_ actually optional.

== Unit Test

=== MASL Round Trip
See `masl_round_trip` report clean results.

== User Documentation

No documentation are required for this change.
