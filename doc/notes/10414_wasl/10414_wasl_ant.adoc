## Analyze Options for ASL BridgePoint
### xtUML Project Analysis Note


### 1. Abstract

This note documents research into a migration of Shlaer-Mellor application
models from iUML into BridgePoint.  Options are explored and observations
recorded.

### 3. Background

Models built with iUML and having MASL activities (action language bodies)
can be migrated into BridgePoint using a tool chain built for project Raven.
A similar process is desired for models build with iUML and having ASL
activities.

### 4. Requirements

4.1 Action Language SWOT  
Analyze the relative strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of
ASL versus MASL versus OAL moving forward.

4.2 ASL Editor  
Explore and size an ASL action language syntax highlighting editor.

4.3 ASL2MASL  
Analyze the costs and benefits of building a tool to convert ASL to MASL.

4.4 ASL2xtUML  
Understand the work required to convert models from iUML / ASL into xtUML
to be edited in BridgePoint (model import).

4.4.1 Diagram Editing  
Enumerate diagram editing issues anticipated as part of model conversion
and ongoing editing Kennedy-Carter idiom models in BridgePoint.  Include
graphics issues and known differences between dialects of xtUML.

4.5 xtUML2ASL  
Determine a strategy for exporting xtUML into the existing model compiler
tool chain (model export).  Determine packaging for the extraction tool
(see Slide A1.2 above) as either a BridgePoint plugin, standalone tool or both.

4.6 File Formats  
Isolate the interface to the model compilation tool chain and document
file formats noting that example files are supplied by client.

4.7 Integrity  
Define steps to ensure and validate the integrity of models through
conversion process.
4.7.1 Round Trip  
Explore the use of "round trip testing" to automate the import and export
and comparison of results.

A3 Sizings  
Establish relative sizings for various components and design choices.
A4 Open Sourcing  
Recommend a path for Open Sourcing existing model compilers and utilities.
A5 Talent Pool  
Recommend the use of internal versus external talent and the community.
A6 Prototypes  
Develop working prototypes and/or mock ups of workflows with screenshots leveraging supplied example files.
A7 Training  
Recommend training in modeling and tooling or ad hoc consultation.
A8 Configuration Management  
iUML provides change configuration inside the tool (versions of domains
and projects defined as a set of domains at a particular version).
Analysis shall propose a path to migrate a particular version of the
current application models and describe how configuration would be managed
after migration. 
A9 Model Compiler Migration  
Following UML tool migration, model compiler migration would be the
logical next step. Perform analysis and define a roadmap for this.
