= WASL Parser and Generator Prototyping

xtUML Project Design Note

:sectnums:

== Abstract

There are two primary links in a WASL/xtUML prototyping chain.  The first
involves parsing WASL on the input/conversion to xtUML.  The second generates
WASL from xtUML instance information.  This note documents the design of
these utilities.

== Background

<<dr-2,2.2>> provides analysis of migration options and recommends
a path forward from iUML to BridgePoint while leveraging the existing
model compiler tool chain.  The analysis explored converting iUML models
represented as WASL flat ASCII files into xtUML and importing them into
BridgePoint.  It also explored ways of exporting WASL-idiom xtUML models
from BridgePoint to WASL to feed downstream to the model translation
build chain.  This design note presumes familiarity with the contents of
that report.

== Requirements

=== Convert WASL to Serial MASL (SMASL) (`WaslParser`)
=== Convert Serial MASL (SMASL) to WASL (`wasl`)

(A6) Prototypes::
Develop working prototypes and/or mock ups of workflows with screenshots
leveraging supplied example files.

== Analysis

In <<wasl-flow>> below, there are two flows.  The top flow illustrates
the convert/import from WASL flat ASCII files into BridgePoint xtUML.
The _WaslParser_ block is the substantive change in this flow relative
to the existing MASL import tooling.  The lower flow shows the export of
WASL flat ASCII files from BridgePoint xtUML.  The block labeled _wasl_
represents most of the work in the export flow.

== Design

- Change name from asl/Asl/ASL to wasl/WaslParser/WASL.
- Honor ordering of stanzas in the .dmp file as needed.
  * There may be some order.  Relationships need to come before object
definitions (maybe).  I think that in m2x the relationships need to be
there so they can be associated with the referential attributes.
- I think we can load/parse the `.dmp` file and process it.
This will not be complete, but it will allow for declaration of
fundamental elements that can be "filled in" by loading/parsing
the subordinate files.
- Add required elements to SMASL.
  * Update the SMASL specification.
  * Update `m2x` and `x2m` to account for updated SMASL specification.

w2x
- Create a new WASL parser that parses structural WASL.
- Parse WASL and emit SMASL.
- Deal with order of relationships, subtypes and objects in `.dmp` file.
- Update wasl2xtuml to deal with classpaths in a DOS environment.
- Compile m2x for DOS (or cygwin).
- Update `maslin` to handle some information missing from input SMASL and
divine it from other sources or from defaults.
- Deal with stack size issue in m2x (PostOooInit 2-dim array of strings).

x2w
- render operations:
- Change name of masl `render` operations to `render_masl`.
- Supply `render_wasl` operations.
- When rendering MASL, invoke the corresponding tree of `render_masl` operations.
- When rednering WASL, invoke the corresponding tree of `render_wasl` operations.
- templates:
- Put templates in subdirectories masl and wasl (and perhaps more to come).
- Supply completely separate set of templates for WASL rendering.

== Design Comments
- What is domainScenarioList?
It is in addition to domainScenarios.
Maybe it is the initialization functions that are to run.

=== Changing the Windows Build to Support wasl2xtuml
. Copy ASLParser.jar to tools/mc/bin/WASLParser.jar.
. Copy antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar to the tools/mc/bin folder.
. Copy wasl2xtuml to the tools/mc/bin folder.
. Copy masl.exe to wasl.exe.
- xtumlmc_build.exe? // Copy xtumlmc_build to tools/mc/bin folder.
