= WASL Parser and Generator Prototyping

xtUML Project Design Note

:sectnums:

== Abstract

There are two primary links in a WASL/xtUML prototyping chain.  The first
involves parsing WASL on the input/conversion to xtUML.  The second generates
WASL from xtUML instance information.  This note documents the design of
these utilities.

== Background

<<dr-2,2.2>> provides analysis of migration options and recommends
a path forward from iUML to BridgePoint while leveraging the existing
model compiler tool chain.  The analysis explored converting iUML models
represented as WASL flat ASCII files into xtUML and importing them into
BridgePoint.  It also explored ways of exporting WASL-idiom xtUML models
from BridgePoint to WASL to feed downstream to the model translation
build chain.  This design note presumes familiarity with the contents of
that report.

== Requirements

=== Incremental, Always Advancing, Never Broken
Do not interrupt or otherwise perturb the behavior of these utilities
when processing MASL!

=== Convert WASL to Serial MASL (SMASL) (`WaslParser`)
=== Convert Serial MASL (SMASL) to WASL (`wasl`)

(A6) Prototypes::
Develop working prototypes and/or mock ups of workflows with screenshots
leveraging supplied example files.

== Analysis

In <<wasl-flow>> below, there are two flows.  The top flow illustrates
the convert/import from WASL flat ASCII files into BridgePoint xtUML.
The _WaslParser_ block is the substantive change in this flow relative
to the existing MASL import tooling.  The lower flow shows the export of
WASL flat ASCII files from BridgePoint xtUML.  The block labeled _wasl_
represents most of the work in the export flow.

WASL-to-xtUML and xtUML-to-WASL Flows

- There may be some order requirement in the .dmp file.  Relationships
need to come before object definitions (maybe).  I think that in m2x
the relationships need to be there so they can be associated with the
referential attributes.
- I think we can load/parse the `.dmp` file and process it.
This will not be complete, but it will allow for declaration of
fundamental elements that can be "filled in" by loading/parsing
the subordinate files.

== Design

- Add required new model elements to SMASL and the models.
  * Update the SMASL specification <<dr-4,2.4>>.
    + Add an attribute to 'object' to support key letters.
  * Update `m2x`, `x2m` and `masl` to account for updated SMASL specification.
    + Add an attribute to the class, 'object', to support key letters.

=== Invocation and Builders
WASL converters, importers and exporters need to be invoked with the
set of parameters appropriate to process correct input and produce correct
output.

==== `wasl2xtuml`

- Update wasl2xtuml to deal with classpaths in a DOS environment.


=== `WaslParser` and `m2x`

- Create a new WASL parser that parses structural WASL.
- Parse WASL and emit SMASL.
- Change name from asl/Asl/ASL to wasl/WaslParser/WASL.
- Honor ordering of stanzas in the .dmp file as needed.
  * Deal with order of relationships, subtypes and objects in `.dmp` file.
  * Consider updating the WASL extraction tool instead; it may be easier.
- Compile m2x for DOS (or cygwin).
- Update `maslin` to handle some information missing from input SMASL and
divine it from other sources or from defaults.
- Deal with stack size issue in m2x (`PostOooInit` 2-dim array of strings).

==== Project Level Deployments

- parse the Extraction and import projects as deployments.
- Update `m2x` to create deployments rather than project compositions.

==== File Format Questions

- What do we do with initialization segments?  (`.scn` files)

=== `x2m` and `wasl`

In regard to the ouput of WASL compatible files, the prototyping effort
provided a proof-of-concept, but did not establish a design approach for
the ultimate WASL rendering engine.  The prototype modified the MASL
code renderer, whereas the approach desired will support both MASL and
WASL.

- render operations:
  * Change name of masl render operations to 'render_masl' on elements
    that differ between MASL and WASL.
    + The top-level render operation is on 'file'.  The packaging of the
      output text is controlled by the model as well as the specifics of
      the text being packaged.
  * Supply 'render_wasl' operations.
  * When rendering MASL, invoke the corresponding tree of 'render_masl' operations.
  * When rednering WASL, invoke the tree of 'render_wasl' operations.
- templates:
  * Put templates in subdirectories `masl` and `wasl`.
  * Supply a separate set of templates for WASL rendering.
- file packaging:
  * Change containerization on MASL to be part of 'render'.
  * Containerize MASL with a query in the render process.
- Place a dialect attribute on population.

==== `xtuml2wasl`

=== Build Process

Update the build dependencies and build scripts to support the above changes.

- Add build artifacts for `wasl` that gets built from `masl`.
- Update the file movement in the releng pom file that populates
`toosl/mc/bin`.

== Design Comments

- What is domainScenarioList?

It is in addition to domainScenarios.
Maybe it is the initialization functions that are to run.

- Must edit the `.dmp` file and move the 'OBJECTS' stanza below
the 'RELATIONSHIPS' and 'SUBTYPES' stanzas.
- Must set the WORKSPACE env var when running `xtuml2wasl`.

=== Changing the Windows Build

The Windows build needs to become more consistent to the unix builds.
The windows build has had the least amount of tools and scripts.
However, the masl tool binaries are actually built on the server for Windows.
We simply do not ship them.

. xtumlmc_build.exe?
  * Copy xtumlmc_build to tools/mc/bin/xtumlmc_build.pl.
  * Change it to strip CRLFs from serial MASL stream.

== User Documentation

== Unit Test

. Run `masl_round_trip` on the build server and see it pass %100.
