xtUML Project Analysis Note

== Abstract

A Shlaer-Mellor standard software architecture is described with enhancements
to suppress leakage of runtime profiles through time and energy usage.

== Introduction and Background

It is desirable to run private applications securely on shared compute
resources.  Some applications require resistence to tampering or reverse
engineering.

== Outline

. Overview of fundamental S-M architecture.
  .. time rules
  .. event rules
  .. penny simulation
  .. strength of the S-M event dispatcher WRT behavior sequencing
    ... example of instrumentation for tracing
      .... IBM fiber channel control unit
      .... BAS "can't happen" war story
  .. exposure of the S-M event dispatcher WRT side channel cryptanalysis
  .. growth of shared resource (cloud) computing
    ... Amazon AWS in particular
. Aims of this presentation
  .. not speaking to existing code body obfuscation techniques
  .. obscuring state sequencing
  .. obscuring message sequencing
  .. obscuring resource (energy) utilization
  .. leveling of resource utilization
. S-M resource usage analyzed
  .. square wave time usage (GPSW figure)
  .. square wave energy usage (GPSW figure)
    ... correlated with state behavior
  .. object/state output represented as letters/numbers (GPSW figure)
. model of S-M architecture
. cryptographically extended model of S-M architecture
. simplistic steganographic translation of multiple models together into
  the same build
. more purposeful steganographic translation of the same model with variation
  of the states and activities
. energy measurement
. demo
  .. Show GPS Watch unobscured.
    ... time profile
    ... energy profile
    ... state, message and energy patterns
  .. Show GPS Watch obscured.
    ... time profile
    ... energy profile
    ... state, message and energy patterns

== Key Points

* S-M time and event rules make tracing behavior really easy.
* Thus, S-M time and event rules make eavesdropping and behavior deduction easier.

== Figures

* square wave representation of GPS Watch running
* object/state output represented as letters/numbers.
* compressibility of this output
