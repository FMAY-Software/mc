### 3. Background

See [[2.3]](2.3).

### 4. Requirements

Requirements from [[2.3]](#2.3) are repeated here for convenience.
(Numbering is preserved from the analysis note.)

4.2 State Save  
4.2.1 The state save API and functionality shall be supplied through a
modeled external entity (EE) which has bridges accessible at the model
level and from hand-written code.  
4.2.1.1 A bridge shall be supplied to trigger a state save to occur.  
4.2.1.2 A bridge shall be supplied to read state save data.  
4.2.2 A program separate from and codependent with the application
shall be used to convert state save data into a human readable form.  
4.2.2.1 The formatting program shall be generated together with the
application.  
4.2.2.3 The format of the human readable state data shall be comma separated
values with one element per line consisting of strings identifying the
element traced.  
4.2.3 State Save Data  
4.2.3.1 A state save contains encoded information representing the
`current_state` of each running state machine in the model.  
4.2.3.3 A state save contains encoded information representing the
sequences of events on the event queues excluding the parameters.  
4.2.4 A marking shall be supplied to enable and configure the state save
feature.  
4.2.4.1 The size of the buffer allocated for state save shall be configured
with marking.  

### 5. Work Required

5.1 Visibility  
Make event queues visible (`extern`) so state save code can "see" them.  

### 6. Implementation Comments

6.1 Current State Change  
The `current_state` of an instance was being changed after the activity
had been executed.  This is changed to be after the transition but before
the activity executes.  This will assure that the correct state is recorded
when a state save is triggered.

### 7. Unit Test

### 8. User Documentation

User documentation was updated for marking for this feature in [[2.4]](2.4).  

### 9. Code Changes
