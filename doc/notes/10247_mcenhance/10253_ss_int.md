### 3. Background

See [[2.3]](2.3).

### 4. Requirements

Requirements from [[2.3]](#2.3) are repeated here for convenience.
(Numbering is preserved from the analysis note.)

4.2 State Save  
4.2.1 The state save API and functionality shall be supplied through a
modeled external entity (EE) which has bridges accessible at the model
level and from hand-written code.  
4.2.1.1 A bridge shall be supplied to trigger a state save to occur.  
4.2.1.2 A bridge shall be supplied to read state save data.  
4.2.2 A program separate from and codependent with the application
shall be used to convert state save data into a human readable form.  
4.2.2.1 The formatting program shall be generated together with the
application.  
4.2.2.3 The format of the human readable state data shall be comma separated
values with one element per line consisting of strings identifying the
element traced.  
4.2.3 State Save Data  
4.2.3.1 A state save contains encoded information representing the
`current_state` of each running state machine in the model.  
4.2.3.3 A state save contains encoded information representing the
sequences of events on the event queues excluding the parameters.  
4.2.4 A marking shall be supplied to enable and configure the state save
feature.  
4.2.4.1 The size of the buffer allocated for state save shall be configured
with marking.  

### 5. Work Required

5.1 Visibility  
Make event queues visible (`extern`) so state save code can "see" them.  

Consider adding attribute `TE_C.class_names`, `TE_SM.state_names`, `TE_SM.event_names`.
Create and sort these once and get rid of existing cheesy code that does this.
Add a sorting routine to sort the states.  A reflexive may be necessary.
Add a sorting routine to sort the events.  A reflexive may be necessary.

### 6. Implementation Comments

6.1 Current State Change  
The `current_state` of an instance was being changed after the activity
had been executed.  This is changed to be after the transition but before
the activity executes.  This will assure that the correct state is recorded
when a state save is triggered.

6.2 `rsl2oal` Pipe Bug  
`rsl2oal` conversion of RSL to OAL was not converting set union.  Any place
that the pipe (`|`) operator was used, the part of the expression starting
from the pipe was omitted from conversion.  This is now fixed in the `rsl2oal`
bison grammar.

6.3 Code Comments  
Action language statements get generated into the code by default.  There
is a mark to turn them off.  However, it was not working; `te_c.CodeComments`
was not being interrogated in the statement roll-up.

6.4 pyrsl bug  
I am running into a situation where .relate is adding a blank line to the
output buffer.  Here are some lines in `q.smt.generate.arc`  
<pre>
  .if ( te_select_related.by_where )
    .select one where_te_val related by act_sel->ACT_SRW[R664]->V_VAL[R611]->TE_VAL[R2040]
    .relate where_te_val to te_select_related across R2074
    .assign te_select_related.where_clause = where_te_val.buffer
    .assign te_select_related.where_clause_OAL = where_te_val.OAL
  .end if
  .relate te_select_related to te_smt across R2069
  .relate te_select_related to start_te_val across R2070
  .relate te_select_related to start_te_var across R2094
  .relate te_select_related to te_lnk across R2073
</pre>

The above `.relate` statements end up adding blanks to my output.  

I raised issue:  [pyrsl 20](https://github.com/xtuml/pyrsl/issues/20)
