xtUML Project Analysis Note


== 1 Abstract

An OOA of MASL is complete.  A parser/loader is complete which reads
textual MASL and populates the OOA of MASL with instances linked and
initialized.  This note documents the current state.

== 2 Introduction, Background and Requirements

Analysis and design notes have been written that outline the requirements
and design of the OOA of MASL and the parser/loader.
See <<dr-3>>, <<dr-4>>, <<dr-6>> and <<dr-7>> for introduction, background
and details on this work.

* MASL loader
* next steps

=== 3.1 Goals

* capture MASL as a model
+
The primary goal of this work is to model MASL and capture the semantics
of MASL in a Shlaer-Mellor xtUML relational class diagram.  This task poses
challenges as MASL is a large and relationally complex domain.
(See <<Model Statistics>>.)

* parse and load correct MASL
+
An OOA of MASL is most useful if it can be populated with MASL models.
To populate the OOA of MASL, textual MASL must be parsed, and instances
of classes in the OOA of MASL must be created, initialized and related.
For this work, an existing parser of textual MASL was re-purposed to load
the OOA of MASL through a functional API.

* anticipate cloud architecture
+
A significant driving motivation for this work is a future cloud-based
architecture which hosts MASL application domains.  Thus, the ability to
build model compilers that emit code targeted to known cloud architectures
(such as AWS) is a requirement.  A good tactic for such model compilation
includes model-based model compilers that emit Java and have flexibility
to incorporate modeled architectural mechanisms for persistence, messaging,
and activity dispatch.

=== 3.2 Strategy

* port MASL model compiler java model
+
The OOA of MASL work ported the existing Java model of MASL as implemented
in the MASL model compiler for {cpp}.  As much as practical the exact name
and relational orientation of the existing Java meta-model are preserved.
This strategy reduces risk, reduces development time and reveals the
existing model in a graphical and accessible way.  The `antlr` lexer and
parser are reused unmodified.  The AST walker grammar is reused, but the
actions on the production rules are replaced.
+
Preliminary analysis of the quality and level of abstraction of this existing
model has been mostly positive.  Looking back, the port strategy has been
a key enabler making this work feasible.

  ** leverage working starting point
+
The MASL {cpp} model compiler has been stable for a number of years.  It is
well understood (albeit by only a few developers).  It is time tested and
functional.

  ** low-risk with large number of artifacts
+
As noted in <<Model Statistics>>, MASL is a substantial domain.  Although it
may be desirable to reanalyze the domain from a "clean slate", time and applied
resources do not allow this.
+
Another scale factor that potentially complicated the task was the size and
number of subsystems.  It is fortunate that BridgePoint supports the concept
of an _Imported Class_ and _spanning relationships_.  With this capability,
subsystem partitioning was achieved to some degree of success.  The 'expression'
subsystem remains unwieldy but editable.  Even in the case of subsystems,
the MASL MC provided a starting point.  'code' was renamed as 'statement'.
'expression', 'statement' and 'type' were factored to reduce the size of
these subsystems.

  ** script conversion of java to MASL
+
Scripting was employed to mechanically begin the porting process.
A `Python` script was drafted that parsed the MASL MC `metamodel` and
`metamodelImpl` folders.  The script was able to extract class names, divine
many attributes and infer most associations between classes and notably
the subtype/supertype hierarchy.

  ** import into BridgePoint
+
Textual MASL output from the Python script was imported into BridgePoint
using the existing `masl2xtuml` flow.  This cycle was repeated while the
MASL was refined.  It was particularly time-saving to name the association
role phrases while the model remained textual MASL.
+
The script employed a strategy to detect spanning relationships.  Duplicate
classes were supplied to subsystems with spanning associations.  After the
subsystem models were imported into BridgePoint, true imported classes were
created, and the relationships were simply moved from the duplicate class
place-holder over to the imported class.

* adjust ported model
+
The ported and imported model was far from complete.  Firstly, no layout
is done automatically.  Layout was accomplished by hard labor alone.
+
Other major adjustments included discerning which member attributes were
true base attributes and which were references.

* refine with action language
+
A deployment model named 'stratus' was created which imported all of the 
subsystems of OOA of MASL.  Action language functions were added to this
model that navigated the OOA of MASL.  Additional functions were added
to resolve names and perform some of the more complex model loading such
as the creation of Relationship Specifications.
+
Finally, action language was added to the AST walker of textual MASL.
While visiting nodes in the abstract syntax tree of MASL, creates,
relates and attribute initializations were performed.  A `LOAD` API is
supplied by the Java model compiler (Ciera <<dr-8>>) to invoke domain
functions composed in the stratus deployment model.

=== 3.3 OOA of MASL

* ooamasl subsystem packages
  ** *binary* operations (factored out of 'expression')
  ** *builtin* types (factored out of 'type')
  ** *domain*
  ** *expression*
+
The 'expression' subsystem remains large.  It may be difficult to
factor out more, because it is awkward and brings little gain to span
sub/super associations.  'binary' and 'literal' were factored out,
because they have several associated classes (subtypes) that are not
direct subtypes of 'expression'.
  ** *invocation* (factored out of 'statement' and 'expression')
+
The 'invocation' subsystem has classes factored out of both 'statement'
and 'expression'.  The 'invocation' subsystem is organized to highlight
the similarity between the statement and expression patterns.  [To the
author of this note, it makes it clear that there is pressure to make
all invocations expressions.]
  ** *literal* types (factored out of 'expression')
  ** *object*
  ** *project*
  ** *relationship*
  ** *statement*
+
[This author recommends that _Statement_ be made a subtype of _Expression_.]
  ** *statemodel*
  ** *type*

=== 3.4 OOA of MASL:  Stratus Deployment

The OOA of MASL is included into a model compiler application called _stratus_.
The OOA of MASL is referenced but not modified.  The Java model compiler (Ciera)
runtime API model is also included.  Loader functionality is implemented in the
_stratus_ deployment.  The deployment consists of a domain component.  This
component imports the OOA of MASL subsystem packages.  Domain functions are
implemented within the component to realize the loading functionality.

The lexer/parser/walker application is linked into the generated Java of the
stratus deployment.  An initialization function is marked to be activated
upon startup of the application.  This 'init' function handles command line
arguments and the invocation of the parser.  It then sequences finalization
of OOA population linking.  It can then invoke rendering functionality to
emit translation text.

==== 3.4.1 Package References and _naked_ OOA of MASL

A package reference is a package linked to another package in another location
(package or project).  Package references allow reuse and _import_ of subsystems.
Subsystem packages from the OOA of MASL are imported into the _stratus_
deployment without modifying the OOA of MASL using this package reference
mechanism.  It is anticipated that OOA of MASL will be imported and reused
in several model translation applications in the future.

The term _naked OOA_ refers to a class model with no state or functional
activity intended to be used as the schema for multiple projects.

In contrast, the OOA of OOA in BridgePoint proper (Editor and Verifier)
is a _decorated_ metamodel.  The bare Shlaer-Mellor class model was
decorated with state machines, class operations and functions to produce
an editor.  Afterwards, this decorated model was further extended to add
simulation capability for the Verifier.  Editing and debugging either
application requires carrying the baggage of both applications.

BridgePoint model compilers began working from a shared _naked_ OOA of OOA
which greatly increased the production speed of new model transformation
tools.  The MASL and WASL import and export tool chains are examples of
this reuse.

A meta-model is most (re)useful as a naked class model.

=== 3.6 MASL Loader

Modeling MASL in OOA as a class diagram is about half the work (given the
opportunity to leverage extant artifacts).  Populating the model from
parsed textual MASL is the other half.  With both of these elements in
place, it is relatively direct to render the populated OOA of MASL into
various textual forms (such as cloud architecture-aware Java).  The effort
to render MASL into textual implementation languages will be a function of
the complexity of the target and the relative 'distance' between MASL and
the target language.

The MASL loader leverages a lexer / parser / walker (hereafter just 'parser')
implemented in `antlr`.  This parser is invocable from the _stratus_
application model.

The extant Java application invoked Java constructors from the actions
on the `antlr` AST walker.  This work follows this pattern but than
invoking constructors on Java classes, it makes calls into the _stratus_
application to create / initialize / relate instances of the OOA of MASL.

Ciera (<<dr-8>>) provides an API which allows `create`, `relate`,
`set_attribute` and `call_function`.  This is sufficient to interface
a parser with a modeled model compiler application.

==== 3.6.1 MASL Loader

* action language functions
+
The functionality of populating the OOA of MASL from textual MASL is
divided between actions on the MASL walker and domain functions implemented
in _stratus_.  OOA of MASL navigation is most easily done in action
language in _stratus_.  Complex queries such as those dealing with name
resolution are best accomplished using action language in the domain
functions supplied by _stratus_.
* `LOAD` class interface to generated model Java
+
Simple functionality such as creating instances, setting attributes and
relating one instance to another across a particular relationship can be
done directly in the parser.  MASL walker actions can invoke `create`,
`relate` and `set_attribute` operations through an API supplied by Ciera
<<dr-8>>.  The ability to invoke a domain function and receive a cast
`Object` is supplied through `call_function`.
* Ciera provides a build chain based upon `maven`.
+
The Ciera wiki provides instructions for getting started.  The build
artifacts are hosted on maven servers whichs makes it straight forward for
network connected machines to spin up a build environment.
* Ciera generated code
* calculator ALU has been primary test model.
* Stratus can parse and load Stratus.
* Generate Hello, world.
+
The _stratus_ application generated a 'Hello, world' text file as the
simplest possible model compiler tempate-based text transformation.
* Generate abstract classes with stratus of stratus.
+
Another example text transformation generates a (simplistic) abstract
Java class for each class in the OOA of MASL.

==== 3.6.2 MASL Loader:  Key Functions

* init
+
This is the initialization function that gets activated at startup of
_stratus_.  It is activated, because it is marked using a mark in
`gen/application.mark`.
* Builtin/InternalType_populate
+
This creates, initializes and relates the pre-existing built-in and
internal type instances.
* select_ObjectDeclaration_where_name
+
Several of these 'select' functions navigate the OOA of MASL and return an
instance into the parser.
* resolve_name
+
Since the OOA of MASL serves as its own symbol table, `resolve_name`
queries the OOA of MASL instance population to resolve named identifiers
to known variables, services, etc. with specific types.
* create_RelationshipSpecification
+
Relationship Specifications represent significant complexity in the OOA of
MASL.
* ReferentialAttribute_resolve
+
Referential attributes may be referenced before they are defined in textual
MASL.  Thus, the parser must take a "2-pass" approach to linking referentials
to their base identifying attributes.

=== 3.7 Next Steps

Next steps include the following:

* review, further test and refinement
* template and rendering HOWTO
* cloud template integration
* Java translation of MASL activities

==== 3.7.1 Review, Refinement and Test

The OOA of MASL is strong but completely unreviewed and only partially
tested.  Since it is largely a port of the existing model as Java the
confidence level is reasonably high.  However, work that is unreviewed
and partially tested is incomplete.  The ALU model, stratus model and test
cases from the MASL round trip regression suite have been used to achieve
some level of coverage.

The model currently is not formalized with identifiers and referential
attributes.  Relatively natural semantic identifiers are composable from most
of _structural_ MASL.  'domain', 'project', 'service', 'attribute', 'state',
'event', 'relationship' and the like have names that make for natural
identifying attributes.  These names can be combined with _upstream_ _parent_
elements to compose unique identifiers out of naming attributes and referential
attributes.

However, this process is not so natural in the 'statement', 'expression' and
'type' subsystems.  For example, a particular 'while' statement does not have a
name, and the 'expression' that conditions the loop carries no natural naming
attributes.

Arbitrary identifying attributes could be introduced at this point to
establish a mechanism for relationship formalization.  However, other options
exist that may be more meaningful and provide a link between the semantics of
the model elements and the syntax of the textual representation.

==== 3.7.2 Template and Rendering HOWTO

The template rendering in this project is strictly inherited from the
underlying Java model compiler (Ciera).  The delivered _stratus_ application
does demonstrate the templating capability.  However, a `HOWTO` document
explaining the process of emitting text from an application linked to the OOA
of MASL would be useful.

==== 3.7.3 Cloud Template Integration

As one of the primary goals of the project is to be informed by future
cloud architectures, it follows that a next step would be to generate
cloud-aware Java.  Aligning work on cloud architecture templates with the
concrete approach supplied by Ciera is a tangible next step.

==== 3.7.4 Java Translation of MASL Activities

There is an "elephant in the room" with regard to an OOA of MASL being
translated using OAL (BridgePoint _Object Action Language_).  The present
model-based model compiler translating MASL is implemented as xtUML and OAL.
To be fully "self-hosted" a model-based model compiler of MASL must be
implemented as MASL.  The best path forward to achieve this is being
explored.

The Ciera Java model compiler maps OAL to Java.  It is conceivable to map
MASL to Java.

The Ciera Java model compiler is a significant benefit coming in
connection with this work.  In partnership with Software Improvements of
Australia, One Fact has commissioned and funded Brooklyn LLC to
commercialize the model compiler.  This includes a clean build environment
and User Guide.  A second phase provides a Developer Guide for engineers
wishing to maintain, extend and modify the model compiler itself.  Already
community members are forking the repository.  It seems there has been
pent-up demand for a solid Java MC for BridgePoint.  Without this model
compiler, the OOA of MASL would be of less value.
