= OOA of MASL:  Parse and Load MASL Activity

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

Enumerate transformation and implementation of the OOA of MASL.

== 2 Introduction and Background


== 3 Requirements

== 4 Work Required

=== 4.1 Steps to Take

* Promote lhs, rhs and operator attributes to supertype of BinaryExpression.
* Promote lhs and rhs relationships to supertype BinaryExpression.
* Promote text from IntegerLiteral and RealLiteral to supertype NumericLiteral.
* Promote loopVariable from LoopSpec subtypes (by removing from subtypes).
* Promote my_reverse from LoopSpec subtypes (by removing from subtypes).
* Change 'name : String' to 'name : Name' to provide a specific UDT for names.
* Promote parameters, returntype and exceptions from DomainService to Service.
* Promote parameters, returntype and exceptions from DomainTerminatorService to Service.
* Add R5402 between ExceptionReference and ExceptionDeclaration.
* Promote parameters, returntype and exceptions from ObjectService to Service.
* Add R5807 between AttributeDeclaration and IdentifierDeclaration.
* Promote parameters, returntype and exceptions from ProjectTerminatorService to Service.
* Promote domain link from Relationship subtypes to RelationshipDeclaration supertype.
* Demote MultiplicityType to enumeration.
* In object, link deferred ObjectService to SubtypeRelationship rather than Relationship.
* Demote EventType to enumeration.
* Demote StateType to enumeration.
* Demote TransitionType to enumeration.
* Omitted ParseExpression.
* Add Alternative to masl_code.

== 5 Implementation Comments

=== 5.1 Questions

* What is 'lhs' and 'rhs' in the context of StringLiteral?
* Does MASL support a list (variable of type list of...) as the argument of an
  invocation?
* Do you think masl::referential is modeled better (as M:M associative)?
* R6013 between RelationshipSpecification and HalfRelationship confuses me.
  How does this work?
* Why does HalfRelationship use ObjectNameExpression, and
  RelationshipSpecification links directly to ObjectDeclaration?  This
  seems backwards to me.

* Which is best, derived structural OOA of MASL or 'masl'?
  ** Derived has benefit of potential reuse of his parser and walker.
  ** 'masl' is more abstract
  ** 'masl' has something of a parser and input path (SMASL).
* What path will be best for parsing and loading?

=== 5.2 Other Work

* Need to define enumerated types.
  ** 'ImplType' for built-in exceptions
  ** 'Visibility':  private, public
* Fix CodeBlock in 'code' ('statement').

=== 5.3 Least Favorite Parts of MM

* HalfRelationship:  Consider 'participation' from masl.
* Referential attributes:  Consider 'referential' from masl.
* State machine:  Consider simpler and cleaner from masl.
