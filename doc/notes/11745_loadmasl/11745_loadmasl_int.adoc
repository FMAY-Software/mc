= OOA of MASL:  Parse and Load MASL Activity

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

Enumerate transformation and implementation of the OOA of MASL.

== 2 Introduction and Background


== 3 Requirements

== 4 Work Required

=== 4.1 Steps to Take

* Promote lhs, rhs and operator attributes to supertype of BinaryExpression.
* Promote lhs and rhs relationships to supertype BinaryExpression.
* Promote text from IntegerLiteral and RealLiteral to supertype NumericLiteral.
* Promote loopVariable from LoopSpec subtypes (by removing from subtypes).
* Promote my_reverse from LoopSpec subtypes (by removing from subtypes).
* Change 'name : String' to 'name : Name' to provide a specific UDT for names.
* Promote parameters, returntype and exceptions from DomainService to Service.
* Promote parameters, returntype and exceptions from DomainTerminatorService to Service.
* Add R5402 between ExceptionReference and ExceptionDeclaration.
* Promote parameters, returntype and exceptions from ObjectService to Service.
* Add R5807 between AttributeDeclaration and IdentifierDeclaration.

== 5 Implementation Comments

=== 5.1 Questions

* What is 'lhs' and 'rhs' in the context of StringLiteral?
* Would MASL support a list as the argument of an invocation?
* Do you think masl::referential is modeled better (as M:M associative)?

=== 5.2 Other Work

* Need to define enumerated types.
  ** 'ImplType' for built-in exceptions
  ** 'Visibility':  private, public
